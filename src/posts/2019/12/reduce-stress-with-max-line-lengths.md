Black Friday just passed and I'm sure there have been plenty of large TV and
computer monitor purchases. I'll be holding off for the ultra wide screen
monitors to come down in price a little more before I get one for myself.&nbsp;

With our monitors getting wider and wider, do we still need maximum line lengths
in our code?&nbsp;

## My answer is yes.

I don't just mean there needs to be maximum line lengths in our code, but I'm
crazy enough to suggest this should be implemented in all areas of a modern
workplace.&nbsp;

- Emails
- Wiki pages
- Word documents

## Why?

Let me answer that with a question. What's easier to read?

```plaintext
Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to you today in regards to a very noisy dog. Your very noisy dog to be precise. Please keep your dog inside the house at night after 9:00 PM so that it does not wake us up from our slumber.

Kindest regards,

Your neighbour
```

Or the email broken upâ€¦

```plaintext

so that it does not wake us up from our slumber.
```

Long if statements like this?

```csharp
if (userName != null && password != null && email != String.Empty && dateTime.IsValid || overrideValidation)
{
  RegisterUser(userName, password, email);
}
```

Or with maximum line lengths?

```csharp
if (userName != null
    && password != null
    && email != String.Empty
    && dateTime.IsValid
    || overrideValidation)
{
  RegisterUser(userName, password, email);
}
```

I believe that if we can reduce the line lengths of our documents, we can make
our lives a little easier at work. Who knows, maybe your colleagues might notice
the extra effort you put into your emails.

Horizontal scroll sure is annoying!
